module _56_OOP_Introduction

// In this series, we'll look at how F# supports object-oriented classes and methods.

// Should you use object-oriented features at all?
// As has been stressed many times before, F# is fundamentally a functional language at 
// heart, yet the OO features have been nicely integrated and do not have a "tacked-on" 
// feeling. As a result, it is quite viable to use F# just as an OO language, as an 
// alternative to C#, say.
// Whether to use the OO style or the functional style is, of course, up to you. Here are 
// some arguments for and against.

// Reasons in favor of using OO features:
// - If you just want to do a direct port from C# without refactoring. (For more on this, 
//   there is a entire series on how to port from C# to F#.)
// - If you want to use F# primarily as an OO language, as an alternative to C#.
// - If you need to integrate with other .NET languages

// Reasons against using OO features:
// - If you are a beginner coming from an imperative language, classes can be a crutch 
//   that hinder your understanding of functional programming.
// - Classes do not have the convenient “out of the box” features that the “pure” F# data 
//   types have, such as built-in equality and comparison, pretty printing, etc.
// - Classes and methods do not play well with the type inference system and higher order 
//   functions (see discussion here), so using them heavily means that you are making it 
//   harder to benefit from the most powerful parts of F#.

// In most cases, the best approach is a hybrid one, primarily using pure F# types and 
// functions to benefit from type inference, but occasionally using interfaces and 
// classes when polymorphism is needed.
