module _67_The_Designing_with_types_series

// In this series, we'll look at some of the ways we can use types as part of the design 
// process. In particular, the thoughtful use of types can make a design more transparent 
// and improve correctness at the same time.
// This series will be focused on the "micro level" of design. That is, working at the 
// lowest level of individual types and functions. Higher level design approaches, and 
// the associated decisions about using functional or object-oriented style, will be 
// discussed in another series.
// Many of the suggestions are also feasable in C# or Java, but the lightweight nature of 
// F# types means that it is much more likely that we will do this kind of refactoring.
