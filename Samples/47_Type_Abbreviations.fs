module _47_Type_Abbreviations
// Also known as aliases

// Let's start with the simplest type definition, a type abbreviation or alias.
// It has the form:
// type [typename] = [existingType]

// where "existing type" can be any type: one of the basic types we have already seen, or 
// one of the extended types we will be seeing soon.
// Some examples:
type RealNumber = float
type ComplexNumber = float * float
type ProductCode = string
type CustomerId = int
type AdditionFunction = int->int->int
type ComplexAdditionFunction = 
       ComplexNumber-> ComplexNumber -> ComplexNumber

// And so on -- pretty straightforward.
// Type abbreviations are useful to provide documentation and avoid writing a signature 
// repeatedly. In the above examples, ComplexNumber and AdditionFunction demonstrate this.
// Another use is to provide some degree of decoupling between the usage of a type and the 
// actual implementation of a type. In the above examples, ProductCode and CustomerId 
// demonstrate this. I could easily change CustomerId to be a string without changing 
// (most of) my code.
// However, one thing is to note is that this really is just an alias or abbreviation; you 
// are not actually creating a new type. So if I define a function that I explicitly say 
// is an AdditionFunction:
type AdditionFunction' = int->int->int
let f:AdditionFunction' = fun a b -> a + b

// the compiler will erase the alias and return a plain int->int->int as the function 
// signature.
// In particular, there is no true encapsulation. I could use an explicit int anywhere I 
// used a CustomerId and the compiler would not complain. And if I had attempted to create 
// safe versions of entity ids such as this:
type CustomerId' = int
type OrderId = int

// then I would be disappointed. There would be nothing preventing me from using an 
// OrderId in place of a CustomerId and vice versa. To get true encapsulated types like 
// this, we will need to use single case union types, as described in a later post.
